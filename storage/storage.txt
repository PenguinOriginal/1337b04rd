If you already have triple-s as a separate project (with its own go.mod), you can:

Import it as a Go module (recommended if it’s reusable elsewhere):

go get github.com/you/triple-s

Create an adapter in internal/storage/adapter/triples.go that wraps it.

OR copy the core storage logic into internal/storage/

This keeps things simpler but ties the code more tightly to 1337b04rd.
